<h4 id="pol3"> Alternation processes (PRI_ALT)</h4>

<b> The PRI_ALT structure</b><br><br>
<p>
The PRI_ALT structure is the same as the ALT one except that if an alternation 
process manage such a  structure then the ready inputs are investigated in the order
 they appear in the switch instruction. <br>
 The index 0 is studied first .<br>
 If the input on channel 0 is ready she is choosen if not the input  on channel 1 is investigated etc ..<br><br>
 
 Beside these channels are two special one who are associated with inputs always ready if their corresponding 
  guards are set TRUE.<br>
  Unlike the other channels the guards of these special channels are  set <b>FALSE</b> by default. <br>
<b>NOTE</b> : If not they would preempt the choice of other channel taken into acount the strategy of choice.<br>
  
These channels are <b>cTIMER</b> and  <b>cSKIP</b> and are specific of 
PRI_ALT alternation processes<br><br>
 <b>cTIMER</b>  if his guard is TRUE  is treated as though it where a ready 
input and permit immediate access to the timer value  .<br>
 <b>cSKIP</b>   if his guard is TRUE is treated as though it where a ready input and may be read immediately.  <br><br>
 
 
 The function writePALT(PRI_ALT *, MSG ) is similar to writeALT(ALT *,MSG) with the same meaning .<br>
 The function readPALT(PRI_ALT *)  is similar to  readALT(ALT *) with the same meaning .<br><br>
 
 The following example illustrate  using   cSKIP channels  with alternation process based on PRI_ALT.<br>
 Examples involving PRI_ALT alternation and timer processes will be given in the chapter relative to TIMER.<br><br>
 
 
 <b> Managing asynchronism</b><br><br>
 As we know communication with channels implies that the processes who communicate are both ready .<br>
 In many situations it may be interesting not to be suspended in the reading of a channel.<br>
 The following program who use a PRI_ALT alternation with a cSKIP channel as input give a (partial) solution to<br>
 this problem. <br><br>
  
 First the cSKIP channel's guard is set to TRUE and the channel become enabled.<br>
 Remember that if the other inputs  are not ready the cSKIP channel is read immediately.<br>
 If nothing is writen by the keyboard process the myproc process may go on without being blocked.<br><br>
<b> NOte</b> : A input relating to a cSKIP (resp cTIMER) channel must be writen as the <b>LAST ONE</b> in the
 switch construct. ( Remember the  strategy of choice of ready inputs for PRI_ALT ) .
