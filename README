                LOccam a OCCAM light implemantation for Arduino .
                Version 1.1


LOccam based upon OCCAM langage is  a wrapper , writen in C,  on the top of the 
FreeRTOS whose adaptation for Arduino boards by Bill Greiman (https://github.com/greiman),
 we choose for our project.
 
LOccam is very simple to learn and implements very few constructs such : PAR, 
CHAN , ALT, TIMER   and is idealy suited for concurrent programming .
There is no need to learn a new language and the Arduino's libraries are
recognized as far as they are by the RTOS .

The manual fully explains the main constructs of LOccam . 
These are illustrated by many examples who where all tested on the ATMega2560  board .
