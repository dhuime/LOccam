<h3 id="pol3">Robot demonstrator</h3>
<p>
This little robot is a demonstrator.<br>
Its function is to show the use of LOccam in robotics. <br><br>

<b>Hardware :</b><br><br>

An Arduino Mega2560.<br>
A Shadow chassis from SparkFun:<br>
2 DC motors and their Ardumoto controller board from SparkFun.<br>
// <br>
A SRF05 ultra-sound telemetry<br>
A light sensor TSL2561 from SparkFun.<br><br>

 <br><br>
 <b>The software</b><br><br>
 
 Written in LOccam the software is structured in 4 processes connected by channels.<br><br>
 
<b>The processes</b><br><br>

Two processes srf05 and tsl2560 manage the sound and light sensors.<br> 
The alternative control process receives information from srf05 and tsl2561. <br>
It processes them, then passes the result of the treatment to motors. <br>
The process motors acts on the wheels of the robot. <br><br>

<b>The channels</b><br><br>

Channel 0, related to the alternative process control, links the srf05 process to the latter. <br>
Channel 1, linked to the alternative control process,  links the tsl2560 process to the latter. <br>
The chanMotors channel links the process control to the motors process.<br><br>

<b>Actions performed by the processes</b> <br><br>

The processes srf05 and tsl2561  only transmit to the control the information from the sensors.<br>
The  process motors only  executes the commands issued by the control.<br>
The control analyzes the data sent by the sensors.<br>
 If the light is too weak it sends the engines the order to stop. <br>
 If the distance from the robot to an obstacle is too short, it orders <br>
 the motors  to turn around.
